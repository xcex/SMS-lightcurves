## Description
The purpose of this code is to compute semi-analytic light curves of the explosion of supermassive stars.

## Publication
This code is associated to the publication
'Signatures of Exploding Supermassive PopIII Stars at High Redshift in JWST, EUCLID and Roman Space Telescope' CÃ©dric Jockel et al. 2025,
and is used to run the model descibed in the paper.


## Usage
To execute the code, simply run
    
    python3 paper_figures.py

No external dependencies are needed apart from standard Python packages. The **code may run for more than an hour** if executed like this, becasue it will run all scripts to produce the figures in the paper back-to-back. If you wish to only reproduce individual figures, you may look at the bottom of paper_figures.py in the __main__ function and (un)-comment the corresponding lines of code.
